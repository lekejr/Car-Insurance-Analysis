## Introduction

The Car Insurance Insights Dashboard is developed to analyze and visualize data related to car insurance policyholders, their claims and demographic factors. This dashboard provides a comprehensive understanding of patterns and trends in insurance claims which can aid in strategic decision making for underwriting, pricing and customer segmentation.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore, analyze and visualize patterns in car insurance data to:
- Identify trends in claims based on car usage, education level, location and other demographics  
- Understand the relationship between household income and insurance claim behavior  
- Derive actionable insights to improve risk assessment and pricing strategies

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Total Household Income**  
- **Total Claim Amount**  
- **Average Claim Amount**  
- **Sum of Claim Frequency**  
- **Number of Customers**  
- **Number of Kids Driving**  
- **Gender and Car Usage**  
- **Car Make and Model Involvement in Claims**  
- **Education Level**  
- **Car Color**  
- **Coverage Zones**  

## Methodology

1. **Data Aggregation**  
   Numerical and categorical features were aggregated to derive total and average values.

2. **Segmentation**  
   Segmented data by gender, education level, car usage and geographical zone for deeper insights.

3. **Visualization**  
   Used bar charts, line graphs and pie charts to present data in an intuitive and comprehensible manner.

4. **Correlation Analysis**  
   Analyzed relationships between household income, claim frequency and claim amount.

## Research Questions

- How does gender and car usage impact insurance claims?  
- What are the most frequently claimed car makes and models?  
- Is there a correlation between education level and claim frequency?  
- Which zones experience higher average claim amounts?  
- Does car color influence claim amount or frequency?  
- What is the relationship between household income, claim frequency and total claims?

## Process

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Feature selection and transformation  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Dashboard design and layout  
5. Insight extraction and interpretation

## Insights

- **Gender and Car Usage**: Both males and females have a higher count of private car usage compared to commercial. Males have slightly higher commercial usage than females.  
- **Kids Driving**: A significant number (16K) of kids are driving which may influence risk profiles.  
- **Car Models**: Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick are the top car brands involved in claims.  
- **Education Level**: Customers with Bachelor's degrees have the highest claim frequency followed by those with a high school education.  
- **Car Colors**: Claim amount and frequency are fairly uniform across different car colors with no single color standing out significantly.  
- **Coverage Zones**: Urban zones have the highest average claim amount at 50.38K while rural zones have the lowest at 49.78K.  
- **Household Income vs Claims**: Despite a household income of 5.53bn only 1.88bn is claimed showing relatively conservative claim behavior.

## Key Findings

- **Education Matters**: Higher educational attainment (PhD or Masters) correlates with fewer claims suggesting better driving habits or lower risk exposure.  
- **Urban Risk**: Urban zones have higher average claim amounts which may reflect more frequent accidents or higher repair costs.  
- **Car Make Influence**: Certain brands like Chevrolet are more frequently involved in claims which could inform risk-based premium adjustments.  
- **Income vs Claiming Behavior**: Customers are not claiming in proportion to their income which could indicate lower loss ratios.

## Conclusion

The Car Insurance Insights Dashboard provides a powerful tool for visualizing insurance data and uncovering patterns that affect claim behavior. By understanding how factors such as education, location and car type influence claims insurers can refine their pricing models, target the right customer segments and mitigate risk more effectively.
